simple_tsdb can be built to run on macOS (12.7.6 or later) or Linux.  The main
requirement is having a compiler that supports c++20; you may be able to build
simple_tsdb on an older macOS system, but I don't have one to test against.

After having cloned the simple_tsdb repo, you need to clone the third_party
submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

Two submodules are used: zlib-ng for compressing data points and editline for
doing line editing in tsdbcli2.  Building editline requires the following
packages: autoconf, automake, libtool.  On macOS these can be installed with
brew, while on Linux you can use your system package manager.

To build them:

    cd third_party/zlib-ng
    ./configure
    make
    cd ../editline
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
    cd ../../

Now you are ready to build simple_tsdb:

    make -j

This will generate binaries in the bin/ subdirectory:

    tsdbcli2
    tsdbclienttest
    tsdbreflector
    tsdbserver
    tsdbtest

If you wish to install the binaries so that they are available system-wide,
you can run the following command to have tsdbcli2, tsdbserver and
tsdbreflector installed in /usr/local/bin:

    make install

simple_tsdb should now be ready for use.
