simple_tsdb has a simple diagnostics TCP port that can be accessed via
localhost on port number 4001 (or as specified by --info-port <port> when
launching tsdbserver).  Connecting to this port causes a dump of all
connections and what they are doing, and then the socket is immediately
closed.  You can use the shell "watch" command to periodically dump this to
your console, much like "top":

    watch -n1 "nc -Nd 127.0.0.1 4001"

That will display an updated dump of the connection table every second.
